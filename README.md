# IdleSow
IdleSow is the only available *mac* cheat for the free game [Warsow](http://www.warsow.net/)

This project is still quite a work in progress, but it is very functional! :)

**There are no binaries available, nor will there be any.** If you can figure out how to build, compile, and inject this thing, then good.
Please don't share the binaries, and don't go on a personal conquest to ruin the game.

That said, here's a [video demonstrating its use](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEsRkUDmN7w)

##Features:
* Aimbot w/ generic prediction. Automatically aims at targets
* Wallhack. Shows enemies, powerups, and other things of interest through walls 
* Mirrorcam. Shows a rear-view camera to catch enemies sneaking up on you.
